# Smart-energy-monitoring-System

Smart laboratories leverage advanced technology and sustainable practices to optimize operations and reduce environmental impact. Over a month, we will collect data on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, recording laboratory session counts, energy consumption, system usage, and CO2 levels. This data provides a comprehensive view of lab activities and their environmental footprint, guiding us towards creating a more efficient and eco-friendly laboratory.
